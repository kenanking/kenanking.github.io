Furthermore, by integrating the concept of dual-band consistency and the fitting capabilities of neural networks, DCDLNet adopts a cross-band and bidirectional supervised (CBS) strategy to mitigate the impact of label noise during the training process. Experiments on measured PolSAR datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms several existing approaches in terms of dual-band fusion and noisy label processing.

However, standard ViTs remain computationally expensive, since global self-attention scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which limits their practicality for high-resolution inputs and resource-constrained settings.
  In this work, we investigate the Reformer architecture as an alternative vision backbone. By combining patch-based tokenization with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) attention, our model approximates global self-attention while reducing its theoretical time complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ in the sequence length $n$. We evaluate the proposed Reformer-based vision model on CIFAR-10 to assess its behavior on small-scale datasets, on ImageNet-100 to study its accuracy--efficiency trade-off in a more realistic setting, and on a high-resolution medical imaging dataset to evaluate the model under longer token sequences.
  While the Reformer achieves higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to our ViT-style baseline, the ViT model consistently outperforms the Reformer in our experiments in terms of practical efficiency and end-to-end computation time across the larger and higher-resolution settings. These results suggest that, despite the theoretical advantages of LSH-based attention, meaningful computation gains require sequence lengths substantially longer than those produced by typical high-resolution images.

Despite recent advances, visual modality faces higher representation learning complexity than textual modality in semantic extraction, which often leads to a semantic gap between visual and textual representations. In addition, conventional fusion strategies introduce cross-modal redundancy, further limiting classification performance. To address these issues, we propose MD-MLLM , a novel image-text classification framework that leverages large multimodal language models (MLLMs) to generate semantically enhanced visual representations. To mitigate redundancy introduced by direct MLLM feature integration, we introduce a hierarchical disentanglement mechanism based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) and orthogonality constraints, which explicitly separates modality-specific and shared representations. Furthermore, a hierarchical fusion strategy combines original unimodal features with disentangled shared semantics, promoting discriminative feature learning and cross-modal complementarity. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, N24News and Food101 , show that MD-MLLM achieves consistently stable improvements in classification accuracy and exhibits competitive performance compared with various representative multimodal baselines. The framework also demonstrates good generalization ability and robustness across different multimodal scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/xiaohaochen0308/MD-MLLM .

Despite recent advances, visual modality faces higher representation learning complexity than textual modality in semantic extraction, which often leads to a semantic gap between visual and textual representations. In addition, conventional fusion strategies introduce cross-modal redundancy, further limiting classification performance. To address these issues, we propose MD-MLLM , a novel image-text classification framework that leverages large multimodal language models (MLLMs) to generate semantically enhanced visual representations. To mitigate redundancy introduced by direct MLLM feature integration, we introduce a hierarchical disentanglement mechanism based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) and orthogonality constraints, which explicitly separates modality-specific and shared representations. Furthermore, a hierarchical fusion strategy combines original unimodal features with disentangled shared semantics, promoting discriminative feature learning and cross-modal complementarity. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, N24News and Food101 , show that MD-MLLM achieves consistently stable improvements in classification accuracy and exhibits competitive performance compared with various representative multimodal baselines. The framework also demonstrates good generalization ability and robustness across different multimodal scenarios.

The DBCF module integrates dynamic cues from radar into the local cross-attention mechanism, enabling the propagation of contextual information across modalities. Meanwhile, the proposed loss functions mitigate the adverse effects of unreliable radar data during training and enhance the instance-level consistency in scene flow predictions from both modalities, particularly for dynamic foreground areas. Extensive experiments on the repurposed scene flow dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing LiDAR-based and radar-based single-modal methods by a significant margin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Mul-VMamba: Multimodal semantic segmentation using selection-fusion-based Vision-Mamba</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2025.115119</link><guid>10.1016/j.knosys.2025.115119</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 02:33:32 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Rongrong Ni</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yuanhui Guo</dc:creator><dc:creator>Biao Yang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yi Liu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hai Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Chuan Hu</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Knowledge-Based Systems</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1016/j.knosys.2025.115119</prism:doi><description>For tasks such as autonomous driving and remote sensing, integrating multimodal data (RGB, depth, infrared, and others) can significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of semantic segmentation under complex environmental conditions, thereby providing precise and reliable information for downstream tasks.

This validates that high-quality semantic representation through structured text provides a powerful and cost-effective paradigm for remote sensing image retrieval.

This dynamic mechanism balances broad exploration and fine-grained focus, thereby enhancing visual perception adaptively and efficiently. Extensive experiments validate Blink, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing visual perception and multimodal understanding.
